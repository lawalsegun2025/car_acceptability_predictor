## Overview

In this project, we build a model that predicts whether a car is acceptible or not before purchasing. There are 4 measures for acceptibility and they are;

## Motivation

## Problem Solving Steps

The following steps will be followed in building this project
1. Load the data into a dataframe
2. Perform Data Preprocessing and feature creation
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and get valuable insights from the data
4. Perform Feature selection
5. Build models and select the best model that fits the data
6. Integrate the model with the User Interface that is created using Flask and Bootstrap
7. Deploy the Machine Learning web app a cloud platform.
